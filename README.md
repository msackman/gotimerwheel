# gotimerwheel
A hierarchical timer wheel in Go

This was inspired by
[Juho Snellman's](https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2016-07-27-ratas-hierarchical-timer-wheel/)
blog post on hierarchical timer wheels. However, other than reading
his blog post, I never read his code. Nevertheless, licensed under MIT
just as is his C++ version.
